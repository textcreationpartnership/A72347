            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For (as S. Auguſtine ſaith) the knowledge of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a great, large &amp; a high palace, but the dore is very low: ſo that the high &amp; arrogant man, can not run in but he muſt ſtowpe lowe, and humble him ſelfe, that ſhall enter into it. Preſumption &amp; arrogancy, is the mother of all error: &amp; humilitie nedeth to feare no error. For humilitie wyl onely ſearch to know the truth, it wyl ſearch, and wyll bryng together one place with an other: &amp; where it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not find out the meaning, it wyl pray, it wil aſke of other that know, &amp; wyl not preſtriupteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; raſhely define any thing, whiche it knoweth not. Therefore the humble man may ſearche any trueth boldly in the ſcripture, without any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of error. And if he be ignoraunt, he ought the more to reade &amp; to ſearch holy ſcripture, to bryng hym out of ignoraunce.

Al the life of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lacke the true fayth is ſynne: and nothing is good without him, that is the auctor of goodnes: where he is not, there is but feyned vertue, although it be in the beſt works.

And foraſmuch as the Phariſies (with theyr moſt peſtilent tradicions, &amp; falſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations &amp; gloſes) had corrupted, &amp; almoſt clerely ſtopped vp thys pure well of <hi>GODS</hi> lyuelye woorde, teaching, that this loue and charitie pertayned one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a mans frendes, and that it was ſuffycyent for a man to loue them, which do loue him, &amp; to hate his fooes: therefore <hi>CHRIST</hi> opened thys well agayne, pourged it, and ſcoured it by geuing vnto his godly lawe of charitie, a true &amp; clere interpretation, which is this: that we ought to loue euery man, both frend and fooe, adding therto, what commoditie we ſhall haue thereby, and what incommoditie by doyng the contrary. What thing can we wyſhe ſo good for vs, as the eternal heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father to rekenne &amp; take vs, for his children? And this ſhall we be ſure of (ſayeth <hi>CHRIST</hi>) if we loue euery manne withoute exception. And yf we doe otherwyſe (ſayeth he) we be no better then the Phariſeis Publicans &amp; Heathen and ſhall haue our rewarde with them: that is, to be ſhut out from the numbre of <hi>GODS</hi> choſen chyldren, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his euerlaſting inheritaunce in heauen.</p>
            <p>Thus of true Charitie <hi>CHRIST</hi> taught, that euery man is bound to loue <hi>GOD</hi> aboue all thynges, and to loue euery man, frend &amp; fooe. And thus lykewyſe he did vſe himſelfe, exhortynge his aduerſaryes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukynge the faultes of hys aduerſaryes, and when he coulde not amende them, yet he prayed for them.
<pb facs="tcp:150496:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fyrſt he loued <hi>GOD</hi> hys father aboue althynges: ſo much that he ſoughte not his owne glorye and wyl, but the glory and wyl of his father.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt al which reaſons, we ought aſwel to ſet the teachyng, as the lyuynge of our Sauyoure Chryſte, who louyng vs (when we were his enemyes) dothe teach vs to loue our enemies. He did paciently take for vs, many reproches, ſuffered beatyng, and moſte cruell death. Therfore we be no membres of him, yf we will not folowe hym. Chryſte (ſayth. S.

               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, we muſt conſydre, that to loue our frendes, is no more but that, which thieues, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, homicides, and al wicked perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do: in ſomuch that Iewes, Turkes, Infideles, &amp; all brute beaſtes, doe loue them that be theyr frendes, of whome they haue their liuing, or any other beneſites.

            <p>Although theſe two cauſes ſeme great &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a worldly man, wherupon he is moued to fear death, yet there is another cauſe much greater then ani of theſe afore reherſed, for which in dede, he hath iuſt cauſe to feare death, and that is, the ſtate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherunto at the laſte ende, death bringeth al them that haue theyr heartes fixed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this world, without repentance and amendment. This ſtate &amp; condition, is called the ſecond death, whiche vnto al ſuch, ſhall inſue after this bodely death. And this is that death, which in dede ought to be dred &amp; feared: for it is an euerlaſting loſſe without remedy, of the grate and fauour of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of euerlaſtynge ioye, pleaſure, and felicitie. And it is not only the loſſe for euer of all theſe eternall pleaſures, but alſo it is the condemnation, both of body and ſoule, (without ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appellation, or hope of redemption) vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtynge paynes in hell. Vnto this ſtate death ſente the vnmerciful and vngodly ryche man (that Luke ſpeaketh of in his goſpel,<note place="margin">Luk, <hi>16,</hi>

               <p>And here are all degrees to be moniſhed, whether they be married or vnmarried, to loue chaſtitie and clennes of lyfe.

               <p>And to auoide fornicacion,<note place="margin">i. Cor. vii.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man haue his own wife, and euerye woman her own huſbande.
